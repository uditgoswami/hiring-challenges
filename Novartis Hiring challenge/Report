PROBLEM STATEMENT: 
Predict if the server will be hacked.

Description:
A company wants to predict the hack of their server. We are provided with userID, and unidentified columns marked from "X1-X16". We have to predict the target Variable "Multiple offense"
which indicates the status of hack. 1 is a positive hack and 0 is a negative hack.

Data:

    Test.csv
    Train.csv

Expected output:

A csv file containing USERID and "Mutliple Offense" columns

Evaluation Criteria

score = recall_score(actual values, predicted values)


Analysis:
This is a problem of Logistic regression type and classification. I used Decision tree Classsifier and got a recall score 0f 98%. It was a fairly easy excercise. Inspite of scoring 98%, I was not selected due to lack of experience. That's got to hurt!
